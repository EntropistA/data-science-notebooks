    "\n",
    "ACID - Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability\n",
    "\n",
    "Atomicity - operations can be fully complete or not at all\n",
    "\n",
    "Transactions - set of commands to execute, if one fails - none of them are executed\n",
    "\n",
    "RDBMS - Relational Database Management System\n",

    "# Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vertically\n",
    "\n",
    "Improving existing machines (more CPU, RAM)\n",
    "\n",
    "- expensive\n",
    "\n",
    "## Horizontally\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding new machines using a proccess called _Sharding_. Different parts of the data are distributed across many machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "- cheap\n",
    "\n",
    "# Database types - SQL, NoSQL\n",
    "\n",
    "- complementory\n",
    "- can coexist\n",
    "\n",
    "## NoSQL\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key-value\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is most often stored on server memory, leading to fast operations. However there is a risk of losing data after power shut off. Therefore, most systems provide disk-memory databases. Keys and values can be of any type which can be changed later. \n",
    "\n",
    "\":\" is a common separator in a key, for example: user:{id}:preferences\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage:\n",
    "- preferences\n",
    "- sessions\n",
    "- shopping carts\n",
    "- recomendations\n",
    "\n",
    "Usuited:\n",
    "- searching values\n",
    "- relations between databases\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "Redis - Remote Dictionary Server, database, cache, message broker, open-source, Lua scripting, asynchronous replication\n",
    "\n",
    "Operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "PUT - inserts new key, value tuple or updates the existing one\n",
    "GET\n",
    "DELETE\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Document\n",
    "\n",
    "_Documents_ are key-value pairs stored inside a _collection_. Schema does not need to be predefined.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage:\n",
    "- Cataloges\n",
    "- CMS\n",
    "- real time analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "- natural\n",
    "- human readable format with JSON\n",
    "- ACID\n",
    "- replication\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations:\n",
    "- data in application code needs attention to keep it simple and consistent\n",
    "- with database increasing there could be need to change values in all of the documents, leading to messy code\n",
    "\n",
    "documents -> rows\n",
    "collections -> tables\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB offer:\n",
    "- MQL - Mongo Query Language\n",
    "- Compass - GUI\n",
    "- Atlas - Database server for AMS, Azure, Google Cloud\n",
    "- Atlas Lake - query and analyze data across AWS S3 and Atlas using MQL\n",
    "- Enterprise Advanced - ability to add MongoDB to the infrastructure\n",
    "- Charts - creating visualizations\n",
    "- Realm - store database locally on Android or iOS\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Column family\n",
    "\n",
    "Features:\n",
    "- very fast writing / retrieving\n",
    "- scales horizontally\n",
    "- each row may have different number of columns (avoids writing default values)\n",
    "- each columns has name, value, timestamp (last usage)\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations:\n",
    "- no joins\n",
    "- no multirow transactions\n",
    "- no subquery support\n",
    "- constly design changes\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage:\n",
    "- large sets of data\n",
    "- time series data\n",
    "- CMS\n",
    "- event logging\n",
    "\n",
    "columns family -> table\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "Data and it's relationships is of the same importance. Each node has properties, edges define relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Features:\n",
    "- flexibility\n",
    "- human readable design\n",
    "- possible horizontal scallability\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations:\n",
    "- high entry qualifications (learning new language, concepts)\n",
    "- no easy way to use with disconnected data\n",
    "\n",
